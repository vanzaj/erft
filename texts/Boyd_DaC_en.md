To comprehend and cope with our environment we develop mental patterns or
concepts of meaning. The purpose of this paper is to sketch out how we destroy
and create these patterns to permit us to both shape and be shaped by a changing
environment. In this sense, the discussion also literally shows why we cannot
avoid this kind of activity if we intend to survive on our own terms. The
activity is dialectic in nature generating both disorder and order that emerges
as a changing and expanding universe of mental concepts matched to a changing
and expanding universe of observed reality.

## Goal

Studies of human behavior reveal that the actions we undertake as individuals
are closely related to survival, more importantly, survival on our own terms.
Naturally, such a notion implies that we should be able to act relatively free
or independent of any debilitating external influences -- otherwise that very
survival might be in jeopardy. In viewing the instinct for survival in this
manner we imply that a basic aim or goal, as individuals, is to improve our
capacity for independent action. The degree to which we cooperate, or compete,
with others is driven by the need to satisfy this basic goal. If we believe that
it is not possible to satisfy it alone, without help from others, history shows
us that we will agree to constraints upon our independent action -- in order to
collectively pool skills and talents in the form of nations, corporations, labor
unions, mafias, etc. -- so that obstacles standing in the way of the basic goal
can either be removed or overcome. On the other hand, if the group cannot or
does not attempt to overcome obstacles deemed important to many (or possibly
any) of its individual members, the group must risk losing these alienated
members.  Under these circumstances, the alienated members may dissolve their
relationship and remain independent, form a group of their own, or join another
collective body in order to improve their capacity for independent action.

## Environment

In a real world of limited resources and skills, individuals and groups form,
dissolve and reform their cooperative or competitive postures in a continuous
struggle to remove or overcome physical and social environmental obstacles
(11, 13) In a cooperative sense, where skills and talents are
pooled, the removal or overcoming of obstacles represents an improved capacity
for independent action for all concerned. In a competitive sense, where
individuals and groups compete for scarce resources and skills, an improved
capacity for independent action achieved by some individuals or groups
constrains that capacity for other individuals or groups. Naturally, such a
combination of real world scarcity and goal striving to overcome this scarcity
intensifies the struggle of individuals and groups to cope with both their
physical and social environments (11, 13).

## Need for Decisions

Against such a background, actions and decisions become critically important.
Actions must be taken over and over again and in many different ways. Decisions
must be rendered to monitor and determine the precise nature of the actions
needed that will be compatible with the goal. To make these timely decisions
implies that we must be able to form mental concepts of observed reality, as we
perceive it, and be able to change these concepts as reality itself appears to
change. The concepts can then be used as decision-models for improving our
capacity for independent action. Such a demand for decisions that literally
impact our survival causes one to wonder: How do we generate or create the
mental concepts to support this decision-making activity?

## Creating Concepts

There are two ways in which we can develop and manipulate mental concepts to
represent observed reality: We can start from a comprehensive whole and break it
down to its particulars or we can start with the particulars and build towards a
comprehensive whole (28/24). Saying it another way, but in a related
sense, we can go from the general-to-specific or from the specific-to-general.
A little reflection here reveals that deduction is related to proceeding from
the general-to-specific while induction is related to proceeding from the
specific-to-general. In following this line of thought can we think of other
activities that are related to these two opposing ideas? Is not analysis related
to proceeding from the general-to-specific? Is not synthesis, the opposite of
analysis related to proceeding from the specific-to-general? Putting all this
together: Can we not say that general-to-specific is related to both deduction
and analysis, while specific-to-general is related to induction and synthesis?
Now, can we think of some examples to fit with these two opposing ideas? We need
not look far. The differential calculus proceeds from the general-to-specific --
from a function to its derivative. Hence is not the use or application of the
differential Calculus related to deduction and analysis? The integral calculus,
on the other hand, proceeds in the opposite direction -- from a derivative to a
general function. Hence, is not the use or application of the integral calculus
related to induction and synthesis? Summing up, we can see that:
general-to-specific is related to deduction, analysis, and differentiation,
while, specific-to-general is related to induction, synthesis, and integration.

Now keeping these two opposing idea chains in mind let us move on a somewhat
different tack. Imagine, if you will, a domain (a comprehensive whole) and its
constituent elements or parts. Now, imagine another domain and its constituent
parts. Once again, imagine even another domain and its constituent parts.
Repeating this idea over and over again we can imagine any number of domains and
the parts corresponding to each. Naturally, as we go through life we develop
concepts of meaning (with included constituents) to represent observed reality.
Can we not liken these concepts and their related constituents to the domains
and constituents that we have formed in our imagination? Naturally, we can.
Keeping this relationship in mind, suppose we shatter the correspondence of each
domain or concept with its constituent elements. In other words, we imagine the
existence of the parts but pretend that the domains or concepts they were
previously associated with do not exist. Result: We have many constituents, or
particulars, swimming around in a sea of anarchy. We have uncertainty and
disorder in place of meaning and order. Further, we can see that such an
unstructuring or destruction of many domains -- to break the correspondence of
each with its respective constituents -- is related to deduction, analysis, and
differentiation. We call this kind of unstructuring a destructive deduction.

Faced with such disorder or chaos, how can we reconstruct order and meaning?
Going back to the idea chain of specific-to-general, induction, synthesis, and
integration the thought occurs that a new domain or concept can be formed if we
can find some common qualities, attributes, or operations among some or many of
these constituents swimming in this sea of anarchy. Through such connecting
threads (that produce meaning) we synthesize constituents from, hence across,
the domains we have just shattered (24). Linking particulars together in
this manner we can form a new domain or concept -- providing, of course, we do
not inadvertently use only those "bits and pieces" in the same arrangement that
we associated with one of the domains purged from our imagination. Clearly, such
a synthesis would indicate we have generated something new and different from
what previously existed. Going back to our idea chain, it follows that
creativity is related to induction, synthesis, and integration since we
proceeded from unstructured bits and pieces to a new general pattern or concept.
We call such action a creative or constructive induction. It is important to
note that the crucial or key step that permits this creative induction is the
separation of the particulars from their previous domains by the destructive
deduction.  Without this unstructuring the creation of a new structure cannot
proceed -- since the bits and pieces are still tied together as meaning within
unchallenged domains or concepts.

Recalling that we use concepts or mental patterns to represent reality, it
follows that the unstructuring and restructuring just shown reveals a way of
changing our perception of reality.(28) Naturally, such a notion implies that
the emerging pattern of ideas and interactions must be internally consistent and
match-up with reality (14, 25). To check or verify internal consistency we try
to see if we can trace our way back to the original constituents that were used
in the creative or constructive induction. If we cannot reverse directions, the
ideas and interactions do not go together in this way without contradiction.
Hence, they are not internally consistent. However, this does not necessarily
mean we reject and throw away the entire structure.  Instead, we should attempt
to identify those ideas (particulars) and interactions that seem to hold
together in a coherent pattern of activity as distinguished from those ideas
that do not seem to fit in. In performing this task we check for reversibility
as well as check to see which ideas and interactions match-up with our
observations of reality (27, 14, 15). Using those ideas and interactions that
pass this test together with any new ideas (from new destructive deductions) or
other promising ideas that popped out of the original destructive deduction we
again attempt to find some common qualities, attributes or operations to
re-create the concept -- or create a new concept. Also, once again, we perform
the check for reversibility and match-up with reality. Over and over again this
cycle of Destruction and Creation is repeated until we demonstrate internal
consistency and match-up with reality (19, 14, 15).

## Suspicion

When this orderly (and pleasant) state is reached the concept becomes a coherent
pattern of ideas and interactions that can be used to describe some aspect of
observed reality. As a consequence, there is little, or no, further appeal to
alternative ideas and interactions in an effort to either expand, complete, or
modify the concept (19). Instead, the effort is turned inward towards fine
tuning the ideas and interactions in order to improve generality and produce a
more precise match of the conceptual pattern with reality (19). Toward
this end, the concept -- and its internal workings -- is tested and compared
against observed phenomena over and over again in many different and subtle ways
(19). Such a repeated and inward-oriented effort to explain increasingly
more subtle aspects of reality suggests the disturbing idea that perhaps, at
some point, ambiguities, uncertainties, anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies
may emerge to stifle a more general and precise match-up of concept with
observed reality (19).  Why do we suspect this?

On one hand, we realize that facts, perceptions, ideas, impressions,
interactions, etc. separated from previous observations and thought patterns
have been linked together to create a new conceptual pattern. On the other hand,
we suspect that refined observations now underway will eventually exhibit either
more or a different kind of precision and subtlety than the previous
observations and thought patterns. Clearly, any anticipated difference, or
differences, suggests we should expect a mismatch between the new observations
and the anticipated concept description of these observations. To assume
otherwise would be tantamount to admitting that previous constituents and
interactions would produce the same synthesis as any newer constituents and
interactions that exhibit either more or a different kind of precision and
subtlety. This would be like admitting one equals two. To avoid such a
discomforting position implies that we should anticipate a mismatch between
phenomena observation and concept description of that observation. Such a notion
is not new and is indicated by the discoveries of Kurt Gödel and Werner
Heisenberg.

## Incompleteness and Consistency

In 1931 Kurt Gödel created a stir in the World of Mathematics and Logic when he
revealed that it was impossible to embrace mathematics within a single system of
logic (12, 23). He accomplished this by proving, first, that any consistent
system that includes the arithmetic of whole numbers is incomplete.  In other
words, there are true statements or concepts within the system that cannot be
deduced from the postulates that make-up the system. Next, he proved even though
such a system is consistent, its consistency cannot be demonstrated within the
system.

Such a result does not imply that it is impossible to prove the consistency of a
system. It only means that such a proof cannot be accomplished inside the
system. As a matter of fact since Gödel, Gerhard Gentzen and others have shown
that a consistency proof of arithmetic can be found by appealing to systems
outside that arithmetic. Thus, Gödel's Proof indirectly shows that in order to
determine the consistency of any new system we must construct or uncover another
system beyond it (29, 27). Over and over this cycle must be repeated to
determine the consistency of more and more elaborate systems (29, 27).

Keeping this process in mind, let us see how Gödel's results impact the effort
to improve the match-up of concept with observed reality. To do this we will
consider two kinds of consistency: The consistency of the concept and the
consistency of the match-up between observed reality and concept description of
reality. In this sense, if we assume -- as a result of previous destructive
deduction and creative induction efforts -- that we have a consistent concept
and consistent match-up, we should see no differences between observation and
concept description. Yet, as we have seen, on one hand, we use observations to
shape or formulate a concept; while on the other hand, we use a concept to shape
the nature of future inquiries or observations of reality. Back and forth, over
and over again, we use observations to sharpen a concept and a concept to
sharpen observations. Under these circumstances, a concept must be incomplete
since we depend upon an ever-changing array of observations to shape or
formulate it. Likewise, our observations of reality must be incomplete since we
depend upon a changing concept to shape or formulate the nature of new inquiries
and observations. Therefore, when we probe back and forth with more precision
and subtlety, we must admit that we can have differences between observation and
concept description; hence, we cannot determine the consistency of the system --
in terms of its concept, and match-up with observed reality -- within itself.

Furthermore, the consistency cannot be determined even when the precision and
subtlety of observed phenomena approaches the precision and subtlety of the
observer -- who is employing the ideas and interactions that play together in
the conceptual pattern. This aspect of consistency is accounted for not only by
Gödel's Proof but also by the Heisenberg Uncertainty or Indeterminacy
Principle.

## Indeterminacy and Uncertainty

The Indeterminacy Principle uncovered by Werner Heisenberg in 1927 showed that
one could not simultaneously fix or determine precisely the velocity and
position of a particle or body (14, 9). Specifically he showed, due to the
presence and influence of an observer, that the product of the velocity and
position uncertainties is equal to or greater than a small number (Planck's
Constant) divided by the mass of the particle or body being investigated.
In other words,

$\Delta V \times  \Delta Q \ge h/m$, where

$\Delta V$ is velocity uncertainty  
$\Delta Q$ is position uncertainty and  
$h/m$ is Planck's constant divided by observed mass.

Examination of Heisenberg's Principle reveals that as mass becomes exceedingly
small the uncertainty or indeterminacy, becomes exceedingly large. Now -- in
accordance with this relation -- when the precision, or mass, of phenomena being
observed is little, or no different than the precision, or mass, of the
observing phenomena the uncertainty values become as large as, or larger than,
the velocity and size frame-of-reference associated with the bodies being
observed (9). In other words, when the intended distinction between
observer and observed begins to disappear (3), the uncertainty values hide
or mask phenomena behavior; or put another way, the observer perceives uncertain
or erratic behavior that bounces all over in accordance with the indeterminacy
relation.  Under these circumstances, the uncertainty values represent the
inability to determine the character or nature (consistency) of a system within
itself. On the other hand, if the precision and subtlety of the observed
phenomena is much less than the precision and subtlety of the observing
phenomena, the uncertainty values become much smaller than the velocity and size
values of the bodies being observed (9). Under these circumstances, the
character or nature of a system can be determined -- although not exactly --
since the uncertainty values do not hide or mask observed phenomena behavior nor
indicate significant erratic behavior.

Keeping in mind that the Heisenberg Principle implicitly depends upon the
indeterminate presence and influence of an observer (14), we can now see
-- as revealed by the two examples just cited -- that the magnitude of the
uncertainty values represent the degree of intrusion by the observer upon the
observed. When intrusion is total (that is, when the intended distinction
between observer and observed essentially disappears,(3) the uncertainty
values indicate erratic behavior. When intrusion is low the uncertainty values
do not hide or mask observed phenomena behavior, nor indicate significant
erratic behavior. In other words, the uncertainty values not only represent the
degree of intrusion by the observer upon the observed but also the degree of
confusion and disorder perceived by that observer.

## Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Confusion and disorder are also related to the notion of entropy and the Second
Law of Thermodynamics (11, 20). Entropy is a concept that represents
the potential for doing work, the capacity for taking action, or the degree of
confusion and disorder associated with any physical or information activity.
High entropy implies a low potential for doing work, a low capacity for taking
action or a high degree of confusion an disorder. Low entropy implies just the
opposite.  Viewed in this context, the Second Law of Thermodynamics states that
all observed natural processes generate entropy (20). From this law it
follows that entropy must increase in any closed system -- or, for that matter,
in any system that cannot communicate in an ordered fashion with other systems
or environments external to itself (20). Accordingly, whenever we attempt
to do work or take action inside such a system -- a concept and its match-up
with reality -- we should anticipate an increase in entropy hence an increase in
confusion and disorder.  Naturally, this means we cannot determine the character
or nature (consistency) of such a system within itself, since the system is
moving irreversibly toward a higher, yet unknown, state of confusion and
disorder.

## Destruction and Creation

What an interesting outcome! According to Gödel we cannot -- in general --
determine the consistency, hence the character or nature, of an abstract system
within itself. According to Heisenberg and the Second Law of Thermodynamics any
attempt to do so in the real world will expose uncertainty and generate
disorder. Taken together, these three notions support the idea that any
inward-oriented and continued effort to improve the match-up of concept with
observed reality will only increase the degree of mismatch. Naturally, in this
environment, uncertainty and disorder will increase as previously indicated by
the Heisenberg Indeterminacy Principle and the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
respectively. Put another way, we can expect unexplained and disturbing
ambiguities, uncertainties, anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies to emerge
more and more often. Furthermore, unless some kind of relief is available, we
can expect confusion to increase until disorder approaches chaos -- death.

Fortunately, there is a way out. Remember, as previously shown, we can forge a
new concept by applying the destructive deduction and creative induction mental
operations. Also, remember, in order to perform these dialectic mental
operations we must first shatter the rigid conceptual pattern, or patterns,
firmly established in our mind. (This should not be too difficult since the
rising confusion and disorder is already helping us to undermine any patterns).
Next, we must find some common qualities, attributes, or operations to link
isolated facts, perceptions, ideas, impressions, interactions, observations,
etc. together as possible concepts to represent the real world. Finally, we must
repeat this unstructuring and restructuring until we develop a concept that
begins to match-up with reality. By doing this -- in accordance with Gödel,
Heisenberg and the Second Law of Thermodynamics -- we find that the uncertainty
and disorder generated by an inward-oriented system talking to itself can be
offset by going outside and creating a new system. Simply stated, uncertainty
and related disorder can be diminished by the direct artifice of creating a
higher and broader more general concept to represent reality.

However, once again, when we begin to turn inward and use the new concept --
within its own pattern of ideas and interactions -- to produce a finer grain
match with observed reality we note that the new concept and its match-up with
observed reality begins to self-destruct just as before. Accordingly, the
dialectic cycle of destruction and creation begins to repeat itself once again.
In other words, as suggested by Gödel's Proof of Incompleteness, we imply that
the process of Structure, Unstructure, Restructure, Unstructure, Restructure is
repeated endlessly in moving to higher and broader levels of elaboration. In
this unfolding drama, the alternating cycle of entropy increase toward more and
more disorder and the entropy decrease toward more and more order appears to be
one part of a control mechanism that literally seems to drive and regulate this
alternating cycle of destruction and creation toward higher and broader levels
of elaboration. Now, in relating this deductive/inductive activity to the basic
goal discussed in the beginning, I believe we have uncovered a Dialectic Engine
that permits the construction of decision models needed by individuals and
societies for determining and monitoring actions in an effort to improve their
capacity for independent action.

Furthermore, since this engine is directed toward satisfying this basic aim or
goal, it follows that the goal seeking effort itself appears to be the other
side of a control mechanism that seems also to drive and regulate the
alternating cycle of destruction and creation toward higher and broader levels
of elaboration. In this context, when acting within a rigid or essentially a
closed system, the goal seeking effort of individuals and societies to improve
their capacity for independent action tends to produce disorder towards
randomness and death. On the other hand, as already shown, the increasing
disorder generated by the increasing mismatch of the system concept with
observed reality opens or unstructures the system. As the unstructuring or, as
we'll call it, the destructive deduction unfolds it shifts toward a creative
induction to stop the trend toward disorder and chaos to satisfy a goal-oriented
need for increased order.

Paradoxically, then, an entropy increase permits both the destruction or
unstructuring of a closed system and the creation of a new system to nullify the
march toward randomness and death. Taken together, the entropy notion associated
with the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the basic goal of individuals and
societies seem to work in dialectic harmony driving and regulating the
destructive/creative, or deductive/inductive, action -- that we have described
herein as a dialectic engine. The result is a changing and expanding universe of
mental concepts matched to a changing and expanding universe of observed reality
(28, 27). As indicated earlier, these mental concepts are employed as decision
models by individuals and societies for determining and monitoring actions
needed to cope with their environment -- or to improve their capacity for
independent action.
