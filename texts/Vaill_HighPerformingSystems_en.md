## Preface


The first thirty-four hypotheses of this paper were produced in one four-hour burst following the lecture-referred to on page 3.  A few days later the eight assumptions and the remarks about joint optimization were written. Other hypotheses have been added since.  Of the various comments which precede the list of hypotheses, the one which I am most interested in concerns the search for "laws of joint optimization".

Those who have read this paper found it interesting, but also rather frustrating and even baffling. When pressed, I have found myself unable to say what a "high-performing system" is, and I am about ready to stipulate that the question which opens the paper is at best a way of getting started and at worst is misleading and maybe a red herring.

I feel I should say that the hypotheses are "intuitive leaps" and not deductions from any theory, although some (e.g., #21) frankly take issue, with prevailing theory. Some hypotheses I am in love with (e.g., 5, 12, 14/15, 24, 34, and 39) and some I am not very interested in. I should also say that I am not very interested at the moment in doing research to verify any of the hypotheses, at least "research" as conventionally conceived. I feel this way because behind the hypotheses is some kind of dimly perceived Gestalt that will evaporate entirely if I become analytical too soon. The Gestalt is the "it" which behaves according to the as-yet unstated laws of joint optimization.

This may all be too mystical for you, and if it is that's o.k.  If it is not, I would like some help in figuring out what the "it" is.

#   TOWARDS A BEHAVIORAL DESCRIPTION OF HIGH-PERFORMING SYSTEMS

Peter B. Vaill


This paper seeks to answer the following question:

> When a system of men and women utilizing some collection of technologies is performing, in relation to some pre-defined goals or standards, in a way which may be described as "excellent" or "outstanding" or "high-performing, what events may be observed in such systems?

The question above contains a number of loosely defined terms which, for the moment, will be left undefined. An overly restrictive definition will prevent us from engaging in the acts of imaginative hypothesizing which are the main focus of this paper. Perhaps a little more clarity can be introduced, though, if it is stipulated that the focus is on systems which are "doing better" than other similar systems, composed of similar persons, utilizing similar technologies, pursuing similar goals or adhering to similar standards.

Before proceeding with the attempt to fashion some behavioral hypotheses about "what is happening" in such high-performing systems, I want to make eight assertions about the field of applied behavioral science. I will not attempt to prove or defend them in this paper. Each of the eight, however, is a characteristic of the field which operates to block one's understanding of the phenomena of high performing systems and must therefore be gotten around somehow if we are to proceed.

1. Most of what we think we know about the performance of work systems derives from research in settings where the human members of the system are not there voluntarily. We have tended to study employees -- people who have to work for a living, and we have studied employers -- people in a role of stewardship relative to external stockholders, whose basic responsibility is to make the organization work in the financial interest of these stockholders.

2. Most organizational research has been problem-oriented: the research has been done in order to throw light on the causes of unsatisfactory performance. Even where the research itself has been purely descriptive in purpose, the underlying motive for conducting or sponsoring it has tended to be normative, i.e., to learn how to make the organization work better.

3. Third, we have assumed that one can extrapolate from the causes of ineffective performance to the causes of more effective performance. For example, if lack of opportunity for decision-making is found to be lacking and an effect on performance seems to exist, then we have assumed that more opportunity for decision-making will produce improved performance.

4. The criteria for evaluating whether a work system is performing satisfactorily or not have tended to be comparative. If one system, for example, is not as profitable as another apparently similar system, then the first system can be assumed to be relatively less effective.

5. Either the human or the non-human (e.g., technological) components of systems have tended to be the focus of most research, with major simplifying assumptions about the components-not-being-studied being made by the researcher.

6. The internal boundaries of the organization which are used by the management for its control purposes have been permitted to define the systems to be investigated. Specification of the system to be studied has tended not to be an empirical question.

7. A major category of research findings has been the observed discrepancy between what is supposed to be happening in the system and what is actually happening. What is supposed to be happening is taken as the standard for a desirable level of system functioning.

8. At key interfaces between the system in question and entities in its environment, the assumption has been that improved coordination and integration of interests "across the boundary" are desirable. We discuss this issue under the heading of "adaptation". The desirability of adaptation tends not to be questioned.

A great deal of what we think we know about management and organizational behavior seem to rest on assumptions such as these. This list has usually been taken for granted by the bulk of studies. Occasionally a study calls one or two of these assumptions into question, but rarely has the whole list been questioned. (Assumption 4 has been questioned fairly frequently. Assumption 5's bankruptcy has been a major tenet of the so-called "socio-technical systems" approach to organizational research and improvement. Some academic organization theorists have fastidiously avoided Assumption 2),

This paper grows originally out of my attempts to get around the 5th assertion above, the "man vs. machine" assumption. The concept of "joint optimization" as it has been developed by the socio-technical systems researchers was taken seriously as an alternative assumption.  However, as the phenomenon of joint optimization was considered more carefully, it became clear that all the other assumptions on the list had to be questioned as well. It is possible that a high-performing system, as defined at the outset of this paper, cannot fully understood so long as any of these eight assertions are permitted to influence research.

In the remainder of this paper, two things are done. First, the concept of "joint optimization" is discussed more fully. Then we will ask: when joint optimization is occurring in a system, what is happening?

## II

Recently in an informal lecture, Eric Trist (of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School) spelled out what "joint optimization" means in a work system. Basically a work system is some organized collection of persons and things. The "things" may be tools and machinery, from the simplest to the most complex elements. The persons may function as individuals and/or in two's and three's, and/or in groupings of a dozen or so, and/or in large organizations. To make the system work, the problem is to get the things, whose behavior is governed by one set of laws, to interface effectively with the men and women whose behavior is governed by another set of laws. The laws which govern the behavior of things are physical laws; for instance, laws of mechanics, thermodynamics, hydraulics, and electronics. The laws which govern the behavior of man are laws of psychology and sociology and anthropology, as well as the perhaps better understood laws of biology. Each set of laws (one for inanimate, one for animate) has its own limits, imperatives, and opportunities. Each is discoverable and manageable by its own particular brands of scientific investigation.

We may go on to observe, from Trist's basic premise, that history has shown man's tendency to attempt to reduce one class of laws to the other. Perhaps the strongest pressure has been to investigate and interpret the behavior of animate entities by the laws of the inanimate. Many theorists have commented on the fascination psychology has had for physics*. It is not hard to demonstrate that the psychological vocabulary owes more to physics than to any other field. But the reverse process occurs as well. The history of Romanticism is, in one sense, the history of the attempt to investigate and interpret the physical world in humanistic terms.

[* Newtonian physics dominates our vocabulary about human behavior.  We are highly dependent on ideas of force, velocity, mass, distance, attraction and repulsion as we attempt to discuss behavior. I often wonder if we have not thoroughly befuddled ourselves about man through such uncritical acceptance of concepts and words from another field.]


"Joint optimization" is that stream of processes in a work system where the various elements are behaving to but not beyond the limits set by the laws which govern their behavior, and where the behavior of any particular element is not preventing some other element from behaving in accordance with the laws which govern it.

A simple example: an automobile may be capable, within the laws which govern it, of going 200 mph. But a particular man may not be capable, within the laws which govern him, of driving it that fast. Therefore, at 200 mph a condition of joint optimization does not exist. The system is unstable and probably cannot endure at that level of performance. Conversely, the man may be capable of controlling an automobile at 200 mph, but the particular car he is driving may not be capable of that sustained speed. Therefore, at or near 200 mph joint optimization is again not occurring. Thus, the problem of joint optimization here would be, "what is the optimal level of performance for a particular man in a particular car under a particular set of road conditions?"


## III

This somewhat abstract discussion can be brought to a concrete focus in the day-to-day conduct of organizations. The problem is seen where we find people doing "well-engineered" jobs which they find intolerable. It is seen where we find "well-qualified" people doing work which does not call forth what they have to contribute. It is seen where we find people "misusing" equipment and other resources because they must in order to behave in the way which they prefer. In the first two cases, the person is asked to behave contrary to the laws governing his behavior in order that the technology may be operated in accordance with laws governing its behavior. In the third case, we see the person behaving according to the laws of his or her behavior at the expense of the laws governing the technology's behavior.  The problem of joint optimization in a work system is a research issue of the greatest importance. It is no longer satisfactory to design one part of the system carefully and let the other parts fall into step. Nor is it any longer satisfactory to design the several elements of the system carefully and expect them to integrate themselves automatically.

We need some"laws of joint optimization" -- some statements at a fairly high level of generality about the limits of persons-operating-technologies. These laws are probably not fully deducible from the laws we now know of men and the laws we now know of technologies. It is, possibly, a set of laws for a new phenomenon that we seek.

A first and tentative step is to look for real-world systems of a fairly conventional and simple kind and to see if we can state what is happening in these systems when they are working well. In the list of hypotheses which follow, I have made some use of what goes on in business organizations and other formal work systems, but I have made at least
as much use of what I think goes on in settings we don't often think about as relevant to management studies. I mean athletic organizations, performing arts (such as music, theater and dance), and various craft specialties.

In the list of hypotheses that follows, it is probably possible to group the several statements in some more organized way than I have. But I have refrained from this because I think a taxonomy is premature.

## IV

In the listing that follows, HPS stands for "high performing system".

1. One may observe a great deal of experimentation and rehearsal in an HPS. Various ways of operating the system are tried. There seems to be only temporary fixation (if at all) on "the one best way" to operate the system, until the system is thoroughly shaken down from members' points of view. Then hypothesis 43 may begin to operate.

2. No one kind of human behavior dominates the system. There is a considerable amount of shifting around among various manual and mental activities.

3. One may note members of the system paying a great deal of attention to "arranging the environment" within which activity is going to occur. Things have to be "just right". Failure to achieve the right arrangement of environmental conditions is sometimes cause for system members to fail to begin the activity, or to terminate it abruptly.

4. A private language and set of symbols arise among members of the system for talking about its conduct and problems. These language systems relate to the nuances and complexities of the system's operation. These language systems are often thought by outside observers to be unintelligible jargon. The functionality of the language is often not apparent.

5. Members evolve a set of indices of system performance which are system-specific and which may not relate easily to any other system, even one which is superficially identical. (See 38, also)

6. When the system is not operating satisfactorily, relative to members' system-specific performance criteria, they become greatly agitated and upset. The consequences of "failure" often seem to observers to be greatly magnified. Observers may feel members "take things too seriously". Hypothesis 34 helps to explain members' intensity.

7. There may be a public, objective theory or "rule book" about how to do the thing that the HPS is doing, but there will always be discrepancies between this public recipe and what the HPS is actually doing. This may be called the "Doug Sanders backswing" hypothesis to remind golfer-readers that orthodoxy is not an absolute virtue.

8. The initial involvement in the activity of the HPS will often have been voluntary for members, and have occurred at a relatively young age. At some point the member will have "turned pro".

9. Where there are three or more people involved in a particular HPS, a set of explicit values and ideologies about what the system does and why it will tend to arise.

10. Communication about how and why the HPS operates as it does from members to outsiders will tend to be in platitudes and generalities, or by showing rather than telling at all. Members will feel and often say, "there's no way I can explain it to you."

11. Hours of work, intensities of effort, and other style variables will tend to be determined by the imperatives of Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, rather than by external agencies which ostensibly "govern" the system.

12. Members will report "peak experiences" in connection with their participation in the HPS. They will "enthuse", "bubble", communicate "joy' and "exultation". (See 34).

13. Performance breakthroughs occur in unplanned ways. Hypothesis 12 will be especially obvious on these occasions. Members will account for the event in relatively non-operational idioms, such as "we finally got it all together". (See 26).

14. The inanimate elements of the system are often anthropomorphized by members of an HPS. Machines become people. Various elements are assumed to have a psychology all their own which a member feels he must relate himself to. Inanimate elements will have names and biographies.

15. A personal relationship between the self and the equipment is therefore felt to develop by a member. ("A pole is a very personal thing to a pole vaulter"...Bob Seagren)

16. Observers may come to feel that members "live, eat, sleep, and breathe" the activity. This perception on the part of observers is an important clue to the existence of an HPS.

17. External controls on the activity of the HPS are seen by members as at best irrelevant, and at worst as positive impediments to performance. Circumvention of the rules tends to be overt and non-apologetic. (See 44).

18. Members may seem to possess general abilities which can be transferred to other systems. This assumption is often incorrect. A \.350 hitter is not just a \.350 hitter, typically, but a \.350 hitter in a context.

19. The system does not have a clear OFF/ON character. Members may regard it as ON when it seems OFF to observers, and OFF when it seems ON. The system's movement from one state to the other is often difficult to detect from the outside.

20. Members seek relief from the pressures of participation in the HPS according to criteria which are internal to the system -- its current phase of operations and the needs and expectations of other members. External schedules for relief and breaks are usually regarded by members as inappropriate.

21. In HPS's, the activities involved in task performance and the activities involved in fellowship and the maintenance of social solidarity within the system may be the same activities to a much greater extent than in non-HPS's.

22. Leaders in HPS's will tend to be persons who are perceived by members as experts in the techniques of the system's basic activity. Leaders' initial status, influence, credibility, and prestige will derive from the demonstration of their expertise.

    22a. Leaders of HPS's will tend not to be "generalists" - i.e., perceived by members as no longer fully expert in performing the system's basic activities.

    22b. The process of leadership in an HPS will tend to be by example and precept. Leaders will be perceived by members as "pacesetters". (See 36)

23. Members of HPS's will exhibit a consciousness of the history tradition, and lore of the system's activity and perhaps of the particular system itself (e.g., "putting on the Yankee pinstripes"). Members' consciousness of the system's lore may persist long after a particular system has ceased to be an HPS.

    23a. Where there a many systems performing a similar set of activities, a "hall of fame" phenomenon will arise.  Membership in the hall of fame will tend to be associated with membership in an HPS.

24. The social value of the output of an HPS is problematic.  Entities in the HPS's environment will not automatically be "pleased" with its output.

    24a. Efforts on the part of entities in the HPS's environment to call forth a particular kind and quality of output will tend to depress motivation in the HPS unless the function described in Hypothesis 25 is performed with extraordinary care and effectiveness.

25. HPS's will tend to evolve various boundary roles for mediating their relations with the environment: managers, handlers, advance men, press agents, interpreters, recruiters, resource scouts, etc.

26. Members of HPS's will tend to discover potentialities in their technology and their separate talents which are not predictable by observers, or deducible by examining the characteristics of various elements taken singly.

27. Members will be found adding to and elaborating upon the inanimate objects of an HPS. They will invent a variety of jigs, props, fixtures, and signaling devices which function to improve their relation to the inanimate objects, make the inanimate objects work better or last longer.

    27a. HPS's will therefore function as the source of inventions which will then be adopted by other similar systems, Many new techniques and pieces of hardware in a given field of activity will have been first used in the HPS's of that field.

    27b. Observers will mistakenly assume that the new methods are the reason a system is an HPS. In fact, the reverse is more likely: new methods don't cause HPS's, HPS's cause new methods,

28. Members tend to engage in a wide range of "nurturing" or "conditioning" or "maintenance" activities on themselves and on the inanimate elements of the system, Maintenance is co-mingled with performance and is not experienced by members as a necessarily separate function.

29. Performances may be called forth from the inanimate side of the system in an HPS which may seem to observers to be impossible. Physical laws may seem to be broken. Such is not the case, but rather the true constraints of physical laws are misperceived by observers, owing to Hypothesis 30. (See 26 also).

30. Unless an observer is a trained performer, he or she cannot detect all the actions which go into the operation of the system, and often he or she cannot detect any but the most overt and prominent actions.

    30a. Some observers will be fascinated by the hidden character of system actions and will evolve research techniques (e.g., videotape instant replay) for investigating the system's operation more closely, HPS's in particular will excite such curiosity. Some observers will become knowledgeable "buffs" regarding an HPS's action and may come to play critical boundary roles with respect to the system's wider environment.

31. Members may tend to develop scenarios of desirable states for the HPS to be in, A considerable amount of apparently meaningless behavior can be explained as attempts to realize these scenarios. The function of all such attempts is to prepare members to participate in the system's operation and to sustain them through its difficult moments. (See 3 also).

32. McLuhan hypothesized that some technologies are "hot" in the sense that their effect on a person requires little physical/psychological participation by him. Members of HPS's will tend to experience the technologies of their system as relatively "cool", i,e., that the moaning of the activity is in the doing of it. (See 14).

33. Members of an HPS may tend to have a powerful esthetic experience regarding the inanimate objects of the system and/or the system's operation. As this process unfolds for members, they may acquire esthetic motivation with respect to the system and seek the experience rather than merely receive it.

34. Hypothesis 33 may be broadened to suggest that kinds of motivation may be found in HPS's which are not detectable in other settings. To the extent that members find participation in the HPS thrilling, they may become "thrill seekers". Activity in the HPS may provide a wide variety of sensual, affective, and cognitive experiences which, over time, members may become "motivated" to attain and re-experience. For the most part, these kind of motivation may be relatively uncomprehensible to observers. They may come to regard members-so-motivated as "weirdos" or "mystics". Negative judgments about members' maturity and even morality may be made by untrained observers.

35. When an HPS ceases to perform to the degree of effectiveness that it had been, members will go through various stages of feeling and behavior in reaction to the decline. One such stage will be the phenomenon of "pressing".

36. When a person has been the leader of an HPS for an extended period, he will become a quasi-mythical figure, embodying in his person much of the meaning which the work of the HPS has for members and aficionado's.

37. Processes of attention in system members will have some attributes that are absent or dormant in non-HPS's:

    37a. The sense of the passage of time will correlate with the perceived temporal process of system performances and will not be a set of awareness apart from system operation. In short, boredom and anticipatory anxiety will tend to be absent.

    37b. The meaning to a member of his own and other members' behavior will be a function of system activities and system ideology (See 9) rather than a function of "personal values" or the norms of the wider culture.

    37c. Many behaviors will be automatic such that a member cannot account later for how or why he did them.

38. Marvin Weisbord has suggested that in HPS's people have ways of keeping track of how they're doing that may be internal and very personal, i.e., involving a highly personalized coding system that may have little meaning to anyone else.

39. HPS's exhibit a rhythm of operation which is both subjectively felt by members and objectively evident to observers. An argot will exist for describing this rhythm, for example, "tempo" (chess); "footing" (yacht racing); "wailing" (improvisational jazz); also, "getting it on" and "grooving" -- and note that "grooving" has been extended in its application to many other activities; "taking it to... (the opposing team)"; "traction" (term coined by W. Baldamus to account for the tendency of an assembly line job to pull the worker along); "hitting one's stride"; "having a hot hand (basketball); "getting the boat set up" (crew); and "mounting a charge" (golf). The general phenomenon that these terms refer to is that the same or improved effects are produced with substantially less effort than before the particular rhythm was achieved.

40. In every HPS, there will be observable a phenomenon, named differently depending on the system, which refers to what in sports is called "execution", i.e., an umbrella word which covers a system of actions which have to be performed with considerable precision in relation to each other.

41. HPS's will pay more attention to the initiation processes of new members than will comparable systems (i.e., engaged in the same activity) which are less successful. Initiation process will have many non-logical components. To external observers they may appear to be "silly", "childish", etc.

42. Members of the HPS will become skilled "real time observers of the process" by which the HPS is doing whatever it is doing. RTOP will be regarded as a principal member responsibility. There may be some role differentiation around this function, i.e., certain members are expected to be especially watchful.

    42a. The greater the discrepancy between one person's ability with RTOP and another's, the more difficulty they will have discussing system performance. Persons without the RTOP ability will always want more "proof" than the person with the ability can supply. Because the knowledge arises in real time, it is hard' to take it out of context.

43. HPS's will be observed to manage the process by which tools and personnel are changed with extreme care. HPS's may appear to be quite "conservative" to observers, i.e., not readily embracing new methods, techniques, personnel, etc.  There may be an overt philosophy of "don't tinker with a good thing". Members will be concerned about not disturbing the experienced equilibrium of the system. (See Hypothesis 39 about rhythm),

44. HPS's will tend to be both aware of their dependencies on environmental elements and relatively uncaring of the amount of effort expended or cost incurred by these environmental elements in order to serve the HPS. In a word, HPS's will exhibit an attitude of "non-guilty exploitation" toward environmental elements which supply them with critical inputs.

45. Observers will feel a compulsion to explain why the system is an HPS (See 30a). Naive observers will tend to account for the HPS simplistically. "Money", "members' individual talents", and "luck" are three factors naive observers will rely on heavily for their explanations.

46. While the system is "in its rhythm" (See Hypothesis 39), the stream of decisions that are necessary to keep the system running occurs in a way that harmonizes and reinforces the rhythm. Pre-established roles are very important, i.e., certain individuals or sub-groups in the system have clear responsibility for making certain decisions.

47. One of the chief disturbances to the rhythm of the system's  operation is the occurrence of a problem requiring a decision which is not provided for in the habitual decision-making process described in Hypothesis 45.

48. A "disturbance" may be such things as the need for new materials; an unexpected demand from the environment ("Encore! Encore!'); unexpected interpersonal conflict in the system; failure of the system's leadership to perform the functions which members have come to expect, and so forth.

49. Non-routine decisions, deriving from "disturbances" necessitate a decision-making process that members may be uncomfortable with, annoyed or frustrated by, etc. In general, the capacity of a system to achieve and maintain a high-performing condition does not guarantee that its decision-making system for "disturbances" will also be a high-performing system.

50. The wider the range of disturbances a system can handle with a known and routinized decision-making system, the more stable it is in its high-performing condition. (Law of Requisite Variety).

51. A "high-performing decision-making system" may be quite discontinuous with and even contradictory to the kinds of activities, role relationships, leadership patterns, and system interaction patterns that constitute the high-performing system's nature as it practices its main mission.  The greater the discrepancy, the more HPS's will tend to develop stabilized parallel systems for making decisions.

52. The difference between all decision-making in HPS's and decision-making in non-HPS's is that the members of the former do not need to deal with the question of ultimate goals and objectives, for these are already understood.


## V

Why speculate at such length about what is going on inside what I have called a "high-performing system"? The basic answer is that if we can understand such systems better, the problem of improving the performance of human organizations may be eased: As noted in the list of assumptions with which this discussion began, social scientists and managers presently groping forward toward improved performance levels without having any norms of what is really possible in mind. It is possible that at least some of those hypothesized properties of HPS's may provide such norms -- targets, as it were, to shoot at.

It is a sobering exercise to go over the list of 52 hypotheses stated above and ask in connection with each one: To what extent are we inadvertently managing our organizations today in such a way as to prevent the emergence of the particular condition the hypothesis is about? We espouse a philosophy of high performance. Our management and leadership literature is full of it. But do we manage and load in such a way as to achieve the hypothesized conditions?
