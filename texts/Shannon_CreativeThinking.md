Up to 100% of the amount of ideas produced, useful good ideas produced
by these signals, these are supposed to be arranged in order of
increasing ability. At producing ideas, we find a curve something like
this. Consider the number of curves produced here -- going up to
enormous height here.

A very small percentage of the population produces the greatest
proportion of the important ideas. This is akin to an idea presented
by an English mathematician, Turing, that the human brain is something
like a piece of uranium. The human brain, if it is below the critical
lap and you shoot one neutron into it, additional more would be
produced by impact. It leads to an extremely explosive of the issue,
increase the size of the uranium. Turing says this is something like
ideas in the human brain. There are some people if you shoot one idea
into the brain, you will get a half an idea out. There are other
people who are beyond this point at which they produce two ideas for
each idea sent in. those are the people beyond the knee of the curve.
I don’t want to sound egotistical here, I don’t think that I am beyond
the knee of this curve and I don’t know anyone who is. I do know some
people that were. I think, for example, that anyone will agree that
Isaac Newton would be well on the top of this curve. When you think
that at the age of 25 he had produced enough science, physics and
mathematics to make 10 or 20 men famous -- he produced binomial
theorem, differential and integral calculus, laws of gravitation, laws
of motion, decomposition of white light, and so on. Now what is it
that shoots one up to this part of the curve? What are the basic
requirements? I think we could set down three things that are fairly
necessary for scientific research or for any sort of inventing or
mathematics or physics or anything along that line. I don’t think a
person can get along without any one of these three.

The first one is obvious -- training and experience. You don’t expect
a lawyer, however bright he may be, to give you a new theory of
physics these days or mathematics or engineering.

The second thing is a certain amount of intelligence or talent. In
other words, you have to have an IQ that is fairly high to do good
research work. I don’t think that there is any good engineer or
scientist that can get along on an IQ of 100, which is the average for
human beings. In other words, he has to have an IQ higher than that.
Everyone in this room is considerably above that. This, we might say,
is a matter of environment; intelligence is a matter of heredity.

Those two I don’t think are sufficient. I think there is a third
constituent here, a third component which is the one that makes an
Einstein or an Isaac Newton. For want of a better word, we will call
it motivation. In other words, you have to have some kind of a drive,
some kind of a desire to find out the answer, a desire to find out
what makes things tick. If you don’t have that, you may have all the
training and intelligence in the world, you don’t have questions and
you won’t just find answers. This is a hard thing to put your finger
on. It is a matter of temperament probably; that is, a matter of
probably early training, early childhood experiences, whether you will
motivate in the direction of scientific research. I think that at a
superficial level, it is blended use of several things. This is not
any attempt at a deep analysis at all, but my feeling is that a good
scientist has a great deal of what we can call curiosity. I won’t go
any deeper into it than that. He wants to know the answers. He’s just
curious how things tick and he wants to know the answers to questions;
and if he sees thinks, he wants to raise questions and he wants to
know the answers to those.

Then there’s the idea of dissatisfaction. By this I don’t mean a
pessimistic dissatisfaction of the world -- we don’t like the way
things are -- I mean a constructive dissatisfaction. The idea could be
expressed in the words, [missing?]. This is OK, but I think things
could be done better. I think there is a neater way to do this. I
think things could be improved a little. In other words, there is
continually a slight irritation when things don’t look quite right;
and I think that dissatisfaction in present days is a key driving
force in good scientists.

And another thing I'd put down here is the pleasure in seeing net results or
methods of arriving at results needed, designs of engineers, equipment, and so
on. I get a big bang myself out of providing a theorem. If I’ve been trying to
prove a mathematical theorem for a week or so and I finally find the solution, I
get a big bang out of it. And I get a big kick out of seeing a clever way of
doing some engineering problem, a clever design for a circuit which uses a very
small amount of equipment and gets apparently a great deal of result out of it.
I think so far as motivation is concerned, it is maybe a little like Fats Waller
said about swing music -- "either you got it or you ain’t." If you ain’t got
it, you probably shouldn’t be doing research work if you don’t want to know that
kind of answer.  Although people without this kind of motivation might be very
successful in other fields, the research man should probably have an extremely
strong drive to want to find out the answers, so strong a drive that he doesn’t
care whether it is 5 o'clock -- he is willing to work all night to find out the
answers and al -- weekend if necessary. Well now, this is all well and good, but
supposing a person has these three properties to a sufficient extent to be
useful, are there any tricks, any gimmicks that he can apply to thinking that
will actually aid in creative work, in getting the answers in research work, in
general, in finding answers to problems? I think there are, and I think they can
be catalogued to an certain extent. You can make quite a list of them and I
think they would be very useful if one did that, so I am going to give a few of
them which I have thought up or which people have suggested to me. And I think
if one consciously applied these to various problems you had to solve, in many
cases you’d find solutions quicker than you would normally or in cases where you
might not find it at all. I thing that good research workers apply these things
unconsciously; that is, they do these things automatically and if they were
brought forth into the conscious thinking that here’s a situation where I would
try this method of approach that would probably get there faster, although I
can’t document this statement.

**The first one that I might speak of is the idea of simplification**.
Suppose that you are given a problem to solve, I don’t care what kind
of a problem -- a machine to design, or a physical theory to develop,
or a mathematical theorem to prove, or something of that kind --
probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate
everything from the problem except the essentials; that is, cut it
down to size.  Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled
with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you
can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see more
clearly what you’re trying to do and perhaps find a solution. Now, in
so doing, you may have stripped away the problem that you’re after.
You may have simplified it to a point that it doesn’t even resemble
the problem that you started with; but very often if you can solve
this simple problem, you can add refinements to the solution of this
until you get back to the solution of the one you started with.

**A very similar device is seeking similar known problems**. I think I
could illustrate this schematically in this way. You have a problem P
here and there is a solution S which you do not know yet perhaps over
here. If you have experience in the field represented, that you are
working in, you may perhaps know of a somewhat similar problem, call
it P', which has already been solved and which has a solution, S', all
you need to do -- all you may have to do is find the analogy from P'
here to P and the same analogy from S' to S in order to get back to
the solution of the given problem. This is the reason why experience
in a field is so important that if you are experienced in a field, you
will know thousands of problems that have been solved. Your mental
matrix will be filled with P's and S's unconnected here and you can
find one which is tolerably close to the P that you are trying to
solve and go over to the corresponding S' in order to go back to the S
you’re after. It seems to be much easier to make two small jumps than
the one big jump in any kind of mental thinking.

**Another approach for a given problem is to try to restate it in just
as many different forms as you can**. Change the words. Change the
viewpoint.  Look at it from every possible angle. After you’ve done
that, you can try to look at it from several angles at the same time
and perhaps you can get an insight into the real basic issues of the
problem, so that you can correlate the important factors and come out
with the solution.  It’s difficult really to do this, but it is
important that you do. If you don’t, it is very easy to get into ruts
of mental thinking. You start with a problem here and you go around a
circle here and if you could only get over to this point, perhaps you
would see your way clear; but you can’t break loose from certain
mental blocks which are holding you in certain ways of looking at a
problem. That is the reason why very frequently someone who is quite
green to a problem will sometimes come in and look at it and find the
solution like that, while you have been laboring for months over it.
You’ve got set into some ruts here of mental thinking and someone else
comes in and sees it from a fresh viewpoint.

**Another mental gimmick for aid in research work, I think, is the
idea of generalization**. This is very powerful in mathematical
research. The typical mathematical theory developed in the following
way to prove a very isolated, special result, particular theorem --
someone always will come along and start generalization it. He will
leave it where it was in two dimensions before he will do it in N
dimensions; or if it was in some kind of algebra, he will work in a
general algebraic field; if it was in the field of real numbers, he
will change it to a general algebraic field or something of that sort.
This is actually quite easy to do if you only remember to do it. If
the minute you’ve found an answer to something, the next thing to do
is to ask yourself if you can generalize this anymore -- can I make
the same, make a broader statement which includes more -- there, I
think, in terms of engineering, the same thing should be kept in mind.
As you see, if somebody comes along with a clever way of doing
something, one should ask oneself: Can I apply the same principle in
more general ways? Can I use this same clever idea represented here to
solve a larger class of problems? Is there any place else that I can
use this particular thing?

**Next one I might mention is the idea of structural analysis of a
problem**. Suppose you have your problem here and a solution here. You
may have two big a jump to take. What you can try to do is to break
down that jump into a large number of small jumps. If this were a set
of mathematical axioms and this were a theorem or conclusion that you
were trying to prove, it might be too much for me try to prove this
thing in one fell swoop. But perhaps I can visualize a number of
subsidiary theorems or propositions such that if I could prove those,
in turn I would eventually arrive at this solution. In other words, I
set up some path through this domain with a set of subsidiary
solutions, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and attempt to prove this on the
basis of that and then this one the basis of these which I have proved
until eventually I arrive at the path S. Many proofs in mathematics
have been actually found by extremely roundabout processes. A man
starts to prove this theorem and he finds that he wanders all over the
map. He starts off and prove a good many results which don’t seem to
be leading anywhere and then eventually ends up by the back door on
the solution of the given problem; and very often when that’s done,
when you’ve found your solution, it may be very easy to simplify; that
is, to see at one stage that you may have short-cutted across here and
you could see that you might have short-cutted across there. The same
thing is true in design work. If you can design a way of doing
something which is obviously clumsy and cumbersome, uses too much
equipment; but after you’ve really got something you can get a grip
on, something you can hang on to, you can start cutting out components
and seeing some parts were really superfluous. You really didn’t need
them in the first place.

**Now one other thing I would like to bring out which I run across
quite frequently in mathematical work is the idea of inversion of the
problem**.  You are trying to obtain the solution S on the basis of
the premises P and then you can’t do it. Well, turn the problem over
supposing that S were the given proposition, the given axioms, or the
given numbers in the problem and what you are trying to obtain is P.
Just imagine that that were the case. Then you will find that it is
relatively easy to solve the problem in that direction. You find a
fairly direct route. If so, it’s often possible to invent it in small
batches. In other words, you’ve got a path marked out here -- there you
got relays you sent this way. You can see how to invert these things
in small stages and perhaps three or four only difficult steps in the
proof.

Now I think the same thing can happen in design work. Sometimes I have
had the experience of designing computing machines of various sorts in
which I wanted to compute certain numbers out of certain given
quantities. This happened to be a machine that played the game of nim
and it turned out that it seemed to be quite difficult. If took quite
a number of relays to do this particular calculation although it could
be done. But then I got the idea that if I inverted the problem, it
would have been very easy to do -- if the given and required results
had been interchanged; and that idea led to a way of doing it which
was far simpler than the first design. The way of doing it was doing
it by feedback; that is, you start with the required result and run it
back until -- run it through its value until it matches the given
input. So the machine itself was worked backward putting range S over
the numbers until it had the number that you actually had and, at that
point, until it reached the number such that P shows you the correct
way. Well, now the solution for this philosophy which is probably very
boring to most of you. I’d like now to show you this machine which I
brought along and go into one or two of the problems which were
connected with the design of that because I think they illustrate some
of these things I’ve been talking about. In order to see this, you’ll
have to come up around it; so, I wonder whether you will all come up
around the table now.
