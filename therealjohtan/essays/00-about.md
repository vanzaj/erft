# About

So here I am at the end of my Ship30for30 course. I've published an
essay everyday for the past 29 days. For this final essay, I thought
I'll look at Twitter Analytics and pick out the essays that resonated
most with people.

### #1 My youngest turns 3 today. I'm learning so much from him and his siblings everyday.

Kids are fearless learners, don't give up easily, and are endlessly
creative. Adults should learn from them.

### #2 Donâ€™t make kids learn coding. Take it from me. I run a coding school for kids.

Coding is just a means to an end. Curiosity, imagination and empathy are
far more important and valuable traits.

### #3 My son is unschooled and he loves it.

Galileo is an online school where students can choose what to learn and
which skills they'll need to thrive in the 21st Century.

### #4 Five things I learnt building an education business the market is not ready for and why I'm still doing it.

Starting a company is about bringing your vision to the world. Stay true
to that vision.

### #5 36 Hours In Joo Chiat. I Live In The Most Hipster Neighbourhood In Singapore. These Are My Favourite Places.

Why I think Joo Chiat is as cool as Hayes Valley in SF, Shoreditch in
London and Tomigaya in Tokyo.

### #6 Kids need to learn how to learn.

The ability to learn how to learn, or meta learning, is arguably the
most important skill every child needs to master.

### #7 I started longboarding at 38 and now I longboard everywhere.

Learning anything new is all about trying, failing, picking yourself up,
and doing it all over again.

### #8 Alternatives to taking on student debt and spending a lifetime paying it off.

Viable alternatives to college degrees - build a digital portfolio,
launch a startup, be a creator.

This writing habit will stay with me, but for now I am going to take a
break from writing and publishing everyday. A few people have asked me
to compile my essays into an e-book. Another idea is to turn some of the
ones listed above into a Twitter thread. This is goodbye for now, not
goodbye forever.

Thank you for reading.
